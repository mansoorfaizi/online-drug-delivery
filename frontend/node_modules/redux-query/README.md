# redux-query

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux-query.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-query)

A library for managing network state in Redux.

## Why use redux-query?

- **It's simply Redux**: Follow best practices for storing and handling network state in Redux, with support for features like optimistic updates and cancellation. There's no magic here, just middleware, actions, selectors, and reducers.
- **It's extensible**: Built to fit most use cases out-of-the-box, but can easily be extended with custom Redux middleware, UI integrations, and network interfaces.
- **It works great with React**: With the provided React hooks and higher-order component in redux-query-react (optional), colocate data dependencies with your components and run requests when components mount or update.

## Examples

- [Simple example](https://amplitude.github.io/redux-query/docs/examples/simple): This example is a very simple web app that has only one feature â€“ you can view and update your username. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how requests and mutations (including optimistic updates) work with redux-query.
